\section{Simulating Current Source Properties in LTSpice}
\label{sec:ltspice_current_source}
This section explains some more advanced concepts of LTSpice \cite{ltspice} to simulate device properties and circuit properties used when working with the current source presented in section \ref{sec:precision_current_source}. This section does not aim at explaining the basic functions of LTSpice, but rather some special functions. It is left to the interested reader to acquire those basic skills. The example presented here, allows to generate the MOSFET \textit{Typical Output Characteristics} plot found in datasheets, the transconductance of a MOSFET and the (dynamic) output impedance of a current source. The typical output characteristics can be used to compare the model with the datasheet or with measurements taken. Comparing these model parameters with the datasheet can establish confidence, that the simulation results can be transferred to a real circuit.

\subsection{MOSFET Typical Output Characteristics}
The output characterisic is a graph found in all MOSFET datasheets and is shown below in figure \ref{fig:ltspice_mosfet_drain_current_example}.

\begin{figure}[hb]
    \centering
    \input{../images/ltspice_mosfet_drain-current_example.pgf}
    \caption{Simulated drain current over the drain-source voltage, also called output characteristics of a MOSFET}
    \label{fig:ltspice_mosfet_drain_current_example}
\end{figure}

Plotting this graph allows to compare the model to the datasheet or the measured values in order to tweak the model. To create this graph the simulation file found in the folder \url{source/spice/mosfet_gm-id.asc} as part of this document can be used. The SPICE simulation for the output characteristics of the MOSFET simulate the following circuit shown in figure \ref{fig:circuit_mosfet_output_characteristic}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
        \centering
        \subimport{../figures/}{ltspice_pmos_output_characteristic.tex}
        \caption{P-channel MOSFET under test.}
        \label{fig:circuit_mosfet_output_characteristic}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../images/ltspice_pmos_output_characteristic.png}
        \caption{LTSpice model.}
        \label{fig:ltspice_mosfet_output_characteristic}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{P-channel MOSFET circuit and its LTSpice model.}
\end{figure}

Do note, that the $V_{DS}$ and $V_{GS}$ are inverted and given as $V_{SD}$ and $V_{SG}$. The reason is, that the plotter in LTSpice works better with positive numbers to guess the correct scaling of the axis. Figure \ref{fig:ltspice_mosfet_output_characteristic} shows the same circuit drawn in LTSpice. The MOSFET parameters are entered using the \textbf{.model} syntax
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, dc}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
.model test_mos pmos (kp=0.813, lambda=4m, Vto=-3.667)
\end{lstlisting}
with the parameters $\kappa = \qty[per-mode=power]{0.813}{\ampere \per \square\volt}$, $\lambda = \qty[per-mode=power]{4}{\per \milli \volt}$ and $V_{th} = \qty{-3.667}{\V}$. The options \textbf{plotwinsize} and \textbf{numdgt} make sure, that LTSpice does not compress the output data and increases the floating point precision. This is important, because $I_D$ spans a large range values. Setting \textbf{gmin} to \num{0} prevents LTSpice from adding small transconductance to every pn-junction, thus changing the MOSFET model. Finally, the most important command is the \textbf{.dc} command, which instructs LTSpice to step the voltage sources $V_{SD}$ and $V_{SG}$ to evaluate $I_D$ over $V_{SD}$. The command
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, dc}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
.dc Vsd 0 2 1m Vsg 3.867 4.467 0.2
\end{lstlisting}
steps the voltage source $V_{SD}$ from $\qtyrange{0}{2}{\V}$ in steps of \qty{10}{\mV} and for each step of $V_{SD}$, steps $V_{SG}$ from \qtyrange{0.2}{0.8}{\V - V_{th}} in steps of \qty{200}{\mV}. Plotting
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, dc}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
Id(M1)
\end{lstlisting}
results in the plot shown in figure \ref{fig:ltspice_mosfet_drain_current_example}, which can be found in datasheets as the \textit{Typical Output Characteristics} plot.
To draw a line in the graph showing the point where the MOSFET enters the saturation region, denoted $I_{sat}$ in figure \ref{fig:ltspice_mosfet_drain_current_example}, as given by equation \ref{eqn:mosfet_id_large_signal}, add the following plot command to the graphing window and resecale the axis.
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, dc}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
0.5*0.813*1A/1V**2*V(vsd)**2
\end{lstlisting}
This command must be adjusted for the value of $\kappa$ and do note, that $\kappa$ is entered with units of \unit{\A \per \square\volt} to correctly display the output in \unit{\A}.

\subsection{MOSFET Transconductance}
Another interesting property to plot is the transconductance $g_m$ of the MOSFET. Again, using the same model used previously in figure \ref{fig:ltspice_mosfet_output_characteristic} and from equation \ref{eqn:mosfet_gm} we known that $g_m$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    g_{m} = \left. \frac{\partial I_{D}}{\partial V_{GS}} \right|_{V_{DS} = const} \,. \nonumber
\end{equation}
To derive $g_m$, we need to generate values of $I_D(V_{GS})$. This can again be done by stepping $V_{GS}$
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, dc}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
.dc Vsg 3.667 4.667 1m
\end{lstlisting}
To produce a smooth plot, the the steps size of $V_{SG}$ was decreased to \qty{1}{\mV}. $V_{DS}$ is now fixed and can be set using the voltage source $V_{SD}$. The MOSFET is intentionally biased into the saturation region at $V_{DS} = \qty{-1}{\V}$ as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:ltspice_mosfet_drain_current_example}.

LTSpice is now able to numerically differentiate the data, which can be invoked by by plotting
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, dc}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
 -d(Id(M1))
\end{lstlisting}

The minus sign comes from the inverted $V_{SG} = -V_{GS}$. To plot $g_m$ over $I_D$, the formula for $g_m$ given above needs to entered manually into the \textit{Expression Editor} by right clicking the expression label on top of the graph. Finally, the x-axis must be changed to $Id(M1)$, leading to the plot in figure \ref{fig:ltspice_mosfet_gm_example}.

\begin{figure}[hb]
    \centering
    \input{../images/ltspice_mosfet_transconductance_example.pgf}
    \caption{Simulated transconductance in saturation at $V_{DS} = \qty{-1}{\V}$.}
    \label{fig:ltspice_mosfet_gm_example}
\end{figure}

As expected from equation \ref{eqn:mosfet_gm}, $g_m$ is proportional to the square root of $I_D$ when the MOSFET is in saturation.

As a sidenote, if the MOSFET model includes gate leakage, this leakage current may influce the calculation of $g_m$, especially at very low currents. In this case, it it better to plot the positive derivative of the source current $Is(M1)$, which does not include the leakage current.
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, dc}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
 d(Is(M1))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Output Impedance}
This sections will explain how to calculate the dyncamic output impedance using LTSpice. The example circuit used, is the precision current source from section \ref{sec:precision_current_source}. The dynamic output impedance was defined in equation \ref{eqn:mosfet_gds} as the inverse of the conductance leading to
\begin{equation}
    R_{out} = \frac{1}{\frac{\partial I_D}{\partial V_{DS}}} \,. \nonumber
\end{equation}

Using the technique presented in the previous section, the obvious solution would be to again use the \textbf{.dc} sweep command and then numerically differentiate the result. Unfortunately this will lead to disappointing results, because the output impedance in question is very large and the limits of the numerical precision will be reached, nicely demonstrating the boundries of numercial methods. LTSpice allows to increase the numeric precision to double using the option \textbf{numdgt}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, dc, options}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
 .options numdgt=15
\end{lstlisting}
Unfortunately, this only forces LTSpice to interally use the double floating point number format, which does have a precision of \qty{53}{\bit} which means $\log_{10}\left(2^{53}\right) = 15.95$ decimals. So instead of using the large-signal model of the MOSFET, it becomes more convenient to evaluate the small-signal model
\begin{equation}
    R_{out} = \frac{v_{load}}{i_D} = \frac{v_{DS}}{i_D} \nonumber
\end{equation}
at several different points of $V_{DS}$, therefore reconstructing the large-signal model from rasterized versions of the small-signal model. For the small-signal model, $v_{DS} = v_{load}$, because the supply voltage and the voltage across the sense resistor can be considered constant, so any change in the voltage across the load must cause the opposite change in the source-drain voltage $v_{SD} = - v_{DS}$.

To run this simulation the small-signal simulation must be used and additionally some commands not available through the graphical user interface need to be entered by hand.

The LTSpice simulation is shown in figure \ref{fig:ltspice_output_impedance_example} and will now be explored.

\begin{figure}[hb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../images/ltspice_output_impedance.png}
    \caption{LTSpice model.}
    \label{fig:ltspice_output_impedance_example}
\end{figure}

The simulation uses the same MOSFET model as above and adds an ideal op-amp to control the loop. The op-amp model has a open-loop gain of \num{2e6} and a gain-bandwidth product of \qty{10}{\MHz} as can be approximated from the the datasheet of the \device{AD797} \cite{datasheet_AD797} and is also given in table \ref{tab:current_source_parameters}. This leads to a \qty{3}{\dB} corner frequency of \qty{5}{\Hz}, which will be interesting later.

To access the small-signal model the \textbf{.ac} command is used, because LTSpice uses the small-signal model to calculate the ac response of a circuit at a given working point. The command
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, ac, dc, options}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
 .ac dec 100 1u 1Meg
\end{lstlisting}
calculates the ac response from \qty{1}{\micro\hertz} to \qty{1}{\MHz} with \qty{100}{points \per decade}.
Additionally, as discussed, the load will be stepped, by stepping voltage source in the source leg of the MOSFET. We use a voltage source in this case instead of a resistor, because the AC impedance of a laser diode is typically very small. For the working point, it does not matter whether $V_{load}$ is resistive or not. To step the voltage source, the command
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, ac, dc, options, step}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
.step param Vload 2.5 3.5 1m
\end{lstlisting}
is used to change $V_{load}$ from \qtyrange{2.5}{3.5}{\V} in steps of \qty{1}{\mV}, which is exactly the maximum $V_{DS}$, which is $V_{sup} - V_{ref} = \qty{3.5}{\V}$. This is done to show the effect of the complete loss of regulation. The last thing to do, is to extract the desired output impedance from the many stepped small-signal simulations. This can be done using the \textbf{.meas} command telling LTSpice to save a single value at certain frequency from each step.
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, xleftmargin=5mm, xrightmargin=5mm, columns=fullflexible, morekeywords={model, ac, dc, options, step, meas}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, basicstyle=\rmfamily]]
.meas AC Ro FIND 1/I(R1) AT 1uHz
\end{lstlisting}
The \textbf{.meas} command shown will save the value of $\frac{1}{i_{D}} = \frac{1}{I(R1)}$ at \qty{1}{\micro\hertz} to the (error) log file whenever the \textbf{.ac} command is run. The value of $v_{DS}$ was already set to \qty{1}{\V_{rms}} in the LTSpice simulation as shown in figure \ref{fig:ltspice_output_impedance_example}, thus $\frac{\qty{1}{\V}}{I(R1)} = R_{out}$. The current through sense resistor instead of $i_D$ was chosen because it is numerically more stable and since there is no gate current it is the same as $i_D$. The frequency were the $R_{out}$ is measured was chosen to be well below the corner frequency of the op-gain, which was calculated above to be \qty{5}{\Hz}. This gives the near DC output impedance of the current source.

To plot the values stored in the log file, click on \textit{View} in top menu, then \textit{SPICE Error Log}. Now right-click on the error log and select \textit{Plot stepp'ed .meas data}. This will open a new plot window showing the output impedance curve.

Those results are discussed in more detail in section \ref{sec:compliance_voltage}.
