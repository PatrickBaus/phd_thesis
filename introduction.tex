\chapter{Introduction}
Highly charged ions offer a unique insight into the very fine details of the world described by quantum electrodynamics (QED). The predictions of the electronâ€™s magnetic moment (g-factor) can easily be regarded as the most accurate prediction in all science, matching the experimental value to \num{10} significant figures \cite{gfactor_theory}. Experimental measurements of the free electron's g-factor have most recently pushed the boundaries as far as an uncertainty of \num{1.3e-13}. The comparison of experimental values of the g-factor with theory therefore represents the most stringent test of the QED theory.

Extending the application of QED to bound states requires new tests of these calculations. Computing of the g-factor in complex systems such as neutral atoms with many electrons is extremely difficult and currently impossible with decent uncertainty \cite{gfactor_theory_codegen}. Using ions helps both theory and experiment because it reduces the complexity and at the same times scales the QED contribution with the nuclear charge number as $Z\alpha$, reducing the required accuracy \cite{gfactor_ions_scaling}. While research has primarily relied on non-optical measurement in Penning traps in the past, laser spectroscopy opens new opportunities \cite{penning_trap_laser_spectroscopy} as the strong scaling of the fine- and hyperfine-structures with $Z^4$ and $Z^3$ brings those transitions into the region of visible and ultraviolet (UV) laser spectroscopy.

Highly charged ions are therefore an interesting field of research with the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research at the forefront and capable of providing up to bare uranium. The AsymmetRic Trap for the measurement of Electron Magnetic moments in IonS (ARTEMIS) experiment at GSI as part of the Highly charged Ions Trap (HITRAP) platform and Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) aims to perform high-precision measurements of the bound electron's g-factor using a combination of laser- and microwave spectroscopy called laser-microwave double-resonance spectroscopy \cite{laser_microwave_double_resonance_spectroscopy}. The ARTEMIS experiment provides a unique optically accessible Penning trap design \cite{penning_trap_transparent,penning_trap_half_open} with the aim of measurements on hydrogen-like bismuth, \ce{^{209}Bi^{82+}}. Currently the experiment is in its commissioning phase using boron-like Argon, \ce{^{40}Ar^{13+}}, targeting a g-factor measurement at the \num{e-9} level \cite{artemis_commissioning}.

Both the commissioning and the measurement on hydrogen-like bismuth require a precision laser system consisting of multiple lasers for the targeted closed transition driven by lasers and microwaves. The accessible wavelength of \ce{^{40}Ar^{13+}} is \qty{441}{\nm} \cite{ar13+_wavelength}, while \ce{^{209}Bi^{82+}} requires a laser at \qty{244}{\nm} \cite{bi82+_wavelength}. Recent years have seen the development of new laser diodes giving diode lasers access to an increasing part of the spectrum. Blue laser diodes were invented in 1994 by \citeauthor{Nakamura_1996} \cite{Nakamura_1996}. This was followed by the first pulsed UV laser diode developed by \citeauthor{uv_pulsed_laser_diode_first} \cite{uv_pulsed_laser_diode_first} in 1995 and 1996 the first continuous wave UV laser diode \cite{uv_cw_laser_diode_first}. These developments then warranted the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics. These development created the opportunity build a compact and economic laser systems for the spectroscopy of highly charged ions entirely based on diode lasers.

For both applications laser systems were proposed and preliminary tests conducted \cite{thesis_baus,thesis_alex,thesis_tilman,thesis_seppo}. These tests have shown severe limitations in the current state of the art in diode laser technology. Most laser diode drivers commercially available are based on the work of \citeauthor{libbrecht_hall} presented in 1993 \cite{libbrecht_hall} which was designed for near-infrared laser diodes and the characteristics of blue laser diodes could not be foreseen at that time. The rapid development of blue light emitting diodes and laser diodes outpaced the development of the electronics to drive them which led to subpar performance of blue and UV diode lasers in comparison to their near-infrared brethren.

This work has has now closed the gap and provides an open-source laser electronics incorporating novel approaches to the design of laser current drivers and temperature controllers for the application in high precision spectroscopy applications. These solutions include modern remote-controllable digital interfaces for controlling large scale experiments.

This work is split into three parts.\\

The \hyperref[sec:preparation]{\textbf{Preparation}} develops the theoretical background by giving a quick introduction into control theory, noise types and current sources. It also presents the requirements for the laser system designed for ARTEMIS.\\

The \hyperref[sec:results]{\textbf{Results}} give a detailed comparison of several laser drivers, both commercial and academic to outline the problems discovered during the testing of a blue laser systems. A laser driver design outperforming all solutions currently available is presented along with a high stability temperature controller specifically designed for the stringent needs of high precision laser spectroscopy. Additionally a compact PID controller system for lab application is presented in the context of lab temperature control together with a data monitoring system capable of logging the manifold data accumulated in a modern experiments and environmental monitoring systems. This data can then be accessed in real-time using a graphical web front end.\\

The \hyperref[sec:outlook]{\textbf{Outlook}} summarized the results developed and, with the sources of electronic noise in diode lasers suppressed, exposes the final barrier imposed by the mechanical design of the laser resonators.
