\subsection{Zener Diode Selection}
Early tests of the LM399 Zener diode as a reference have confirmed, what the data sheet \cite{datasheet_LM399} already suggest in the 'Low Frequency Noise Voltage' plot. There are random bi-stable voltage step changes. This phenomenon is called burst noise or popcorn noise.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \caption{Popcorn noise in different samples of the LM399 over a \qty{24}{\hour} period.}
    \label{fig:popcorn_noise_lm399}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:popcorn_noise_lm399} shows two samples of the LM399, that exhibit popcorn noise, while the last one does not.

The sources of popcorn noise in semiconductor devices are not yet fully understood, but some sources have been identified. Defects in the semiconductor crystal lattice and contamination of the semiconductor material have been linked to popcorn noise \cite{technote_ti_popcorn_noise}. This problem has improved over the years as manufacturing processes and wafer quality has evolved. Unfortunately the LM399 is built around a process from 1991, as can be seen etched into the die \cite{lm399_richi}.

The popcorn noise caused by defects and contamination can be reduced by lowering the strain on the lattice and removing surface contaminants on the die. This can be can be achieved using a high-temperature burn-in process. Manufacturers like Fluke and Keysight use similar techniques in their products. Fluke, for example, uses a period of \qty{60}{\day} burn-in for their references \cite{zener_popcorn_noise}.

Fortunately, the LM399 is a heated reference, which regulates its die to \qty{90}{\celsius} when turned on, so it is only required put the diodes in a simple test circuit and wait. The use of a separate test setup instead of the final circuit has both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage is, that the Zener diode will subjected to mechanical stress when soldered, this stress will not be removed by the burn-in process as it happens after the testing, when diode is soldered into the final circuit, but this mainly affects the voltage drift properties of the Zener diode and not the popcorn noise. The drift of the diode is also only of secondary concern in our setup, as the drift is mainly caused by the reference resistors used and are typically at least an order of magnitude worse than the the drift of the diode judging by the data sheet \cite{datasheet_LM399,datasheet_VPR}.

The advantages of testing the Zener diodes separately, on the other hand, are, that more diodes can be tested at the same time, as a special compact test fixture can be used. It is also simpler to remove the diodes from the test fixture, because they be socketed. Therefore for our application a separate test board was used. Building this test setup is detailed in the next sections.

\subsection{Building a Test Setup for Zener Diodes}
There are several ways to measure the popcorn noise of semiconductor devices. The most trivial one is to directly monitor the device in the time-domain. In this case, the Zener voltage can be monitored with a long-scale multimeter. It requires a low noise DMM, that can reliably distinguish between both voltage levels, which are about \qty{4}{\micro \volt} apart.
A related option is to use a second reference, whose voltage is similar to the device under test (DUT). Measuring the the voltage difference between the two references, less resolution is required. Directly comparing the difference of two references using a millivolt meter is commonly done when intercomparing primary voltage references. This method, however, increases the measurement noise by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$, if both references produce the same level of uncorrelated noise. The noise of the LM399 with a \qty{100}{\plc} integration time (\qty{2}{\second}) is about \qty{1.5}{\micro \volt_{pp}} as can be determined from the data in figure \ref{fig:popcorn_noise_lm399}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    %\input{figures/lm399_popcorn_noise.pgf}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{example-image-golden}
    \caption{Voltage noise of an LM399, measured with a bandwidth of \qtyrange{0.1}{10}{\Hz}.}
    \label{fig:noise_lm399}
\end{figure}

Measuring two references against each other would then result in around \qty{2.1}{\micro \volt} of noise. This make distinguishing the jumps possible, but challenging.

A third option is to use a high-pass filter and an amplifier. Additionally, the signal can be low-pass filtered to remove any excess high frequency noise. This approach also requires less resolution than directly measuring the voltage, because the signal-to-noise-ratio is improved du the amplifier. It is therefore possible to use an off-the-shelf analog-to-digital converter (ADC). One such circuit, along with some examples, is demonstrated in \cite{technote_ti_popcorn_noise,kay2012operational}. It must be noted, that due to the high-pass filtering, it not possible to measure slow voltage drifts using this method.

The forth and final option presented here, is approaching the problem in the frequency domain and requires a low-noise amplifier with a low frequency cutoff. As it was already discussed in section \ref{}, popcorn noise is found to have a frequency dependence of $1/f^2$. This can be used to distinguish it from other random noise processes that show a frequency dependence of $1/f$. An good example is given in Horowitz and Hill in \textit{The Art of Electronics} on page 478 \cite{horowitz1989}. Going to frequencies below \qty{10}{\Hz}, one can sort the references by their noise spectrum.

In this work only options one and two were were tested, as it was said above, with options three and four there is a chicken and egg problem. One needs a number on known good devices to compare other DUTs to. At the start of the evaluation, most of the data available about the LM399 was from the data sheet. Compiling a dataset of the performance of dozens of LM399 is expensive and time consuming and companies typically treat such data as a closely guarded secret.

The next section deals with the choice of multimeter to satisfy the requirements test the Zener diodes according to options one and two, so either directly measuring the output voltage or difference of a known good sample against the DUT.

\subsection{Choosing a Multimeter for Testing Zener Diodes}
The DMM used plays an important role for the test setup. In this section, some of the challenges, that can be encountered will be discussed. The expected amplitude of the popcorn noise is around \qty[per-mode=symbol]{0.5}{\micro\volt \per \volt} or \qty{3.5}{\micro\volt} of the output voltage, when considering the \qty{7}{\volt} Zener voltage of the LM399 diode.

The \qty{7}{\volt} will typically be measured on the \qty{10}{\volt} range. It is not a trivial task, because a signal-to-noise-ratio of \qty[per-mode=symbol]{0.35}{\micro\volt \per \volt} or more than \qty{130}{\decibel} is required. This calls for a device, that not only has the required resolution, but also the stability over time and temperature to ensure the measurement will not be distorted by the DMM.

Therefore, a voltmeter with lower noise and a more stable reference, than the DUT is mandatory. This only leaves the class of very low noise \num{7.5} or \num{8.5} digit multimeters. These multimeters feature a different type of voltage reference, because the LM399 is not suitable due to its noise. The only Zener diodes that meet those requirements are the Analog Devices LTZ1000 \cite{datasheet_LTZ1000}, the Motorola SZA263 (out of production) and the Linear Technology (LT) LTFLU-1, a proprietary design by Fluke and LT. The LTZ1000, for example, is specified for a typical noise of \qty{1.2}{\micro\volt_{pp}} in a frequency range of \qtyrange{0.1}{10}{\Hz} \cite{datasheet_LTZ1000}. Additionally, in comparison to the LM399, those Zener diodes do not suffer from the popcorn noise issue.

The equipment manufacturers typically have a preference for one of those diodes. Keysight utilizes the LTZ1000, Fluke uses the SZA263 (in older devices) or the LTFLU-1 in newer model, while Keithley employs the LTZ1000 in their \device{Model 2002} and the LTFLU-1 in the newer \device{DMM7510}, because they were bought by Fortive, the same company that owns Fluke. To sum it it up, Keysight uses the LTZ1000 and Fluke/Keithley the LTFLU-1 in their top end meters.

Comparing only \num{7.5} and \num{8.5} digit voltmeters, narrows down the choice of multimeters considerably. The market for high-end \num{8.5} digit DMMs is limited and therefore every device on the market caters for a certain niche. It is therefore prudent to look at their specifications to choose the correct device for this purpose. In table \ref{tab:list_of_dmms} a list of popular \num{8.5} DMMs can be found. Several models included in the table, are already discontinued, but these DMMs can still be acquired on the second-hand market.

    \caption{Overview of \num{8.5} digit multimeters.}
    \label{tab:list_of_dmms}
\end{table}

While the author has not tested every multimeter in table \ref{tab:list_of_dmms}, it is possible to judge some of them apriori by their specifications. The \device{Solartron 7081} (also sold as \device{Guildline 9578}) is a less optimal choice, because a conversion takes \qty{52}{\s} for \num{8.5} digits. The discontinued \device{Fluke 8508A} and the \device{Wavetek 1812} multimeter are very similar devices, because Fluke bought Wavetek in 2000 and as a result, the \device{Fluke 8508A} is more of an update to the \device{Wavetek 1812} than a new device. They are both in included in the list, because it is very rare to see one of the Fluke devices on the second hand market, while the \device{Wavetek 1812} can be found with a bit of patience. Again they are fairly slow, taking \qty{25}{\second} for a conversion at \num{8.5} digits.

The other multimeters are still in production and similar in price, but their field of use is slightly is different. The \device{Fluke 8588A} excels at stability and features a modern user interface, whereas the \device{Keysight 3458A} is unbeaten in linearity and noise. A detailed comparison of those two meters can be found in the work of \citeauthor*{article_fluke_8588A_noise} \cite{article_fluke_8588A_noise}. The \device{Keithley Model 2002} focuses on its scanning capability and the \device{Transmille 8104} does have electrometer functions. Unfortunately, the \device{8104} is also fairly slow at \num{8.5} digit with conversions taking \qty{4}{\s} at its fastest setting \cite{datasheet_transmille8104}, so it will not be considered.

To narrow it down even further, several \num{7.5} and \num{8.5} digit multimeters were tested. The results of those tests will be discussed here to give an impression of the performance of these devices. The tested multimeters are the \device{Keysight 3458A}, the \device{Keithley Model 2002}, the \device{Keysight 34470A} and a \device{Keithley DMM6500}. The \device{3458A} was chosen, because it is very fast and already used in section \ref{} of this work. The \device{Model 2002} was chosen for its internal scanning unit. The \device{34470A} was chosen as a lower-end and cheaper alternative and because it is a fairly low noise device. Finally the \device{DMM6500} is on the list to compare a DMM with an LM399 reference. A \device{Fluke 8588A} was not tested, because it was not released at the time of testing and the older model \device{8508A} is considered too slow as mentioned above.

\minisec{The tests}

Two test were run on this selection of devices. The first one was done using a \device{Fluke 5440B} calibrator supplying \qty{10}{\volt} to all mulimeters and taking readings over the course of a week. This data was used to estimate the noise and the stability of the multimeters, including burst noise. The noise of the DMM at \qty{10}{\volt} is typically not found in the datasheet, because the noise performance is usually quoted for shorted inputs, which does not include the internal reference noise. This test allows to check for popcorn noise of the internal reference. The calibrator has a specified output noise of \qty{< 1.5}{\micro \volt} within a bandwidth of \qtyrange{0.1}{10}{\Hz} at \qty{1}{\volt} and is stable to within \qty{5}{\micro \volt_{RMS}} over \qty{30}{\day}, a specification far superior to the LM399.

The second test was done using a known bad LM399 voltage reference instead of the calibrator. This test was done to see how well a DMM can make out the popcorn noise.

Based on these two tests, a multimeter was chosen for an automated test setup to bin the LM399s.

\minisec{Test Setup}

The tests were done in a stable and monitored lab environment, with a temperature deviation of at most $\Delta T = \qty{\pm 0.2}{\kelvin}$. All multimeters were connected to the same DUT. Although this might potentially cause interference between the multimeters due to the pump out current spikes caused by the switching interals, no ill effects, like voltage offsets or increased noise, were observed during the setup of the tests. A more detailed discussion of the pump out current of the \device{3458A} can be found in \cite{article_3458A_input_mpedance}.

The three \num{8.5} and \num{7.5} digit multimeters were connected using shielded cables, either Pomona 1167-60 or self-made cables. See section \ref{} for details on the self-made cables. The GUARD terminal of the calibrator was connected to chassis GROUND at the calibrator and then connected to the cable shield. On the \device{3458A}, the shield was connected to the GUARD terminal and the GUARD switch was set to open according to the manual \cite{manual_keysight3458a}. For the other multimeters, that do not have a GUARD terminal, the shield was left floating at the DMM side. Additionally the \device{Fluke 5440B}, the \device{HP 3458A} and the \device{Keysight 34470A} have an autocalibration routine, which was run once prior to the measurement. The detailed settings used for the DMMs can be found in the appendix \ref{appendix:dmm_test} on page \pageref{appendix:dmm_test}, a summary ist given in table \ref{tab:dmm_settings_concise} to show the important differences.

\begin{table}[ht]

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Concise list of differences in the settings used for comparing the DMMs.}
    \label{tab:dmm_settings_concise}
\end{table}

All DMMs were configured to have a similar conversion time. This lead to different integration times, which are given in power line cycles at \qty{50}{\Hz}. The \device{Model 2002} takes considerable longer for a measurement than the Keysight multimeters. The reason is the auto-zero function, which is shown in figure \ref{dmm_autozero_comparison}. The \device{Model 2002} does three steps when doing auto-zeroing, it measures the signal, the zero point for an offset compensation and also the reference voltage for a gain correction. In comparison, the \device{3458A} only corrects for the offset drift. The gain is adjusted when using the ACAL function. The former auto-zero routine, therefore takes longer by one half, but results in more stable measurements.

These measurements were done by measuring the output voltage of a pre-production version of the reference PCB for the digital current driver. The reference board was kept at \qty{23}{\celsius} in a custom thermal chamber. The chamber is detailed in section \ref{}. Additionally, a \qty{500}{\g}  bag of Bentonite desiccant was added to keep the references at a low humidity of around \qty{20}{\percent} relative humidity. The reference board inserted into a motherboard holding up to 4 reference modules. The motherboard, also called LM399 breakout board, provides the voltage regulators and the operational amplifier for the kelvin sensed pins of the reference. The multimeter was directly connected to the reference via a DB9 connector, without an other components in between the reference and the DMM like buffers, multiplexers or filters. The DMM itself was exposed to the ambient temperature of the lab. The setup is shown in figure \ref{fig:lm399_vs_34470a_setup}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \label{fig:lm399_vs_34470a_setup}
\end{figure}

The reference boards amplify the Zener voltage to \qty{10}{\volt}, which improves the signal to noise ratio, because it makes use of the full DMM range. The \qty{10}{\volt} range is typically the lowest (relative) noise and lowest drift range those multimeter because no internal pre-amplifiers of attenuators are required. It is important to keep the temperature drift of the DMM low or at least predictable, because the device is exposed to the ambient laboratory and not in a temperature controlled environment like the references.

\newpage
The reference is a negative \qty{10}{\volt} reference that uses a self-biasing technique to derive its \qty{1}{\mA} Zener current from its own \qty{-10}{\volt} output. The details of this circuit are discussed in section \ref{}.

% \end{figure}

With the amplified output the expected burst noise step size of about \qty[per-mode=symbol]{0.5}{\micro\volt \per \volt}, becomes \qty{5}{\micro\volt}. The resolution of the \qty{10}{\volt} range of the \device{34470A} is \qty{100}{\nano \volt}, but the measurement is not limited by quantization. See section \ref{} of this work for a detailed characterization.

    \label{fig:lm399_vs_34470a}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:lm399_vs_34470a} shows an example of such measurement. This measurement highlights one the problems encountered during those measurements. From this measurement it is unclear whether the features seen in the graph are only a result of ambient temperature changes due to the cycling of the air conditioning or popcorn noise on top of that. These results hightlight the fact, that sub-\unit{ppm} measurements not only requires high-end gear, but also a very stable environment. From the data it follows, that the temperature coefficient of the DMM in linear approximation is:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha_\device{34470A} \approx \frac{\qty{6.08}{\micro\volt}-(-\qty{9.30}{\micro\volt})}{(\qty{21.85}{\celsius}-\qty{19.96}{\celsius})\qty{10}{\volt}} = \qty[per-mode=symbol]{0.86}{\micro\volt \per \volt \per \kelvin}
\end{equation}

While the temperature coeeficient is vastly better than the specified \qty[per-mode=symbol]{2}{\micro\volt \per \volt \per \kelvin} \cite{datasheet_keysight34470A}, it is not low enough for this type of measurement. The multimeter must therefore be kept in a temperature controlled environment. This issue was resolved by replacing the stock air conditioning controller with a custom PID controller as discussed in section \ref{}. Lastly, the noise floor of the measurement is \qty{1.5}{\micro\volt_{RMS}}, resulting in an estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of about \qty{10}{\decibel}, which is suffient to detect the popcorn noise.

While the temperature issue was being worked on, testing of the Zener diodes continued. To work around the temperature drift of the DMM, the amplification of the reference voltage was increased to \qty{15}{\volt}, the same voltage required by the digital current driver, and a differential measurement was realized. This measurement was done against a primary \qty{15}{\volt} reference board. To ensure, that any popcorn noise found originates only in the DUT and not the primary reference used, several reference boards where tested against a \device{Fluke 5440B}. The \device{5440B} does not exhibit popcorn noise as it uses a different voltage reference ic, namely two Motorola SZA263 in series \cite{service_manual_fluke_5440b}. Finally, a board that did not show popcorn noise in a period of three days was selected. The serial number of this primary or golden reference is \textit{\#1}.

Using this differential technique, the results greatly improved

In order to test a large amount of Zener diodes, and considering the duration of the burn-in process, which can take anything between \qtyrange{100}{1000}{\hour}, it is necessary to have an automated setup. This consists of a digital multimeter (DMM) a scanner and test board, that holds the Zener diodes and provides the necessary infrastructure for the diodes.



To conclude, we need a high performance DMM, a scanner, and a test fixture. The choices will detailed in the following sections.



\subsection{A Scanner System for Testing Zener Diodes}
As discussed before the diodes need to be tested for \qty{1000}{\hour} and it is not be feasible to test them individually. So a minimum of 10 diodes must be tested at the same time. To keep the system compact, the test setup a scanner to multiplex a single multimeter input. Several commercial options currently available were considered for this project and are shown in table \ref{tab:list_of_daqs}.

A recent trend to more compact devices has led major manufacturers to include multimeters in the scanner mainframe creating so called data acquisition units. Legacy devices, that only have switching capabilities are no available. For example Keithley replaced the small desktop switch mainframe \device{Model 7001} with the \device{DAQ6510} and Keysight is offering the \device{DAQ973A}, a scanning \num{6.5} digit DMM, that accepts extension cards. Unfortunately, for this project, as discussed above, the integrated \num{6.5} digit multimeter does not add any value.

The simplest option is to go with an \num{8.5} digit multimeter that already included a scanner option or buy a used \device{Keithley 7001} from a second-hand dealer. The author has tested both options and the simplicity of only having a single device to connect and program makes the integrated scanner card of the \device{Model 2002} very attractive.

\end{figure}

The scanner card used to multiplex the DMM does have to meet several specifications. The most important aspects are the number channels and the lifetime of the relays. Other factors, such as channel to channel isolation, the contact potential, resistance and maximum voltage is not the limiting factor.

The reason is, that in this case, the voltage is low, there is no ac component involved and the the typical input impedance of high-end multimeters is far more than \qty{100}{\giga\ohm} \cite{datasheet_fluke8588A,article_3458A_input_mpedance_2,datasheet_keithley2002,article_3458A_input_mpedance}.



In this work the Keithley (now Tektronix) \device{Model 2002} was chosen for three reasons. It is a very compact system requiring only a half-sized 2U rack in comparison to the other DMMs, that are typically full-sized 2U rack devices. The other two advantages are the integrated scanner card slot, that allows to to fit a 10 channel scanner card and finally the \qty{20}{\volt} range. The latter is interesting for testing the final voltage reference boards, as these have a \qty{15}{\volt} output, which is too much for the \qty{10}{\volt} range of most DMMs, so that testing the voltage reference Printed circuit boards
(PCBs) one would have to switch to the \qty{100}{\volt} range and forgo an extra digit of resolution and add more noise.



The test setup consists of a mounting PCB, that holds up to 20 Zener diode. It provides power regulation and a minimal circuit required to support each diode. This circuit is given here:

The compensation network is required when using the ADR1399, because of its very low dynamic impedance as recommended in the data sheet \cite{datasheet_ADR1399}. It is not strictly required for the LM399, but fitted nonetheless, because there are no downsides to it. This makes the board compatible with both types of references. Each Zener output is protected using an output buffer, which provides isolation and short circuit protection. Finally there is a common mode filter at the output to suppress high frequency noise via ground loops.

The two key metrics of concern, that need to measured are popcorn noise and drift.

As a sidenote, for the pure entertainment of the author, several batches of LM399 Zener diodes were purchased from non-authorized dealers. Some were marked as refurbished, the others were not marked as such, but clearly were. These so-called refurbished diodes are not to be used in production devices. To entertain and warn the reader a small selection of examples are shown here in figure \ref{fig:fake_lm399}. All but one diode, which is shown for comparison, are refurbished.

As it can be clearly seen, the sellers have gone to some effort to hide the fact, that these diodes have been used before. When a through-hole is soldered to the PCB, its legs will be trimmed to match the PCB thickness. In order to conceal this, the legs need to be extended to their original length. The legs of the LM399 are Kovar, because the LM399 is hermetically sealed with a glass seal and Kovar has the same coefficient of expansion as borosilicate glass. The forgers typically weld steel legs to the Kovar legs and then either gold-plate or tin them, as can be seen in fig. \ref{fig:fake_lm399_legs}.

Much to the delight of the author the refurbished diodes prove valuable for educational purposes. As the origin and method of extraction from the original circuit is unknown, but can be imagined to be rather savage, the diodes are typically faulty. They can therefore be used to validate the test setup and demonstrate the popcorn noise found in the LM399. A very good example in shown in fig. \ref{fig:fake_lm399_popcorn_noise}.

TODO: Chinese/Ebay Zeners. Welded legs. Photots. Decap one of those.
