The starting point has been the IMC-PID tuning rules that have achieved widespread industrial acceptance. The rule for the integral term has been modified to improve disturbance rejection for integrating processes. Furthermore, rather than deriving separate rules for each transfer function model, there is a just a single tuning rule for a first-order or second-order time delay model. Simple analytic rules for model reduction are presented to obtain a model in this form, including the “half rule” for obtaining the effective time delay.},

Corresponding units are proposed for a classification of industrial processes in terms of the two principal characteristics affecting their controllability. Formulas are given which enable the controller settings to be determined from the experimental or calculated values of the lag and unit reaction rate of the process to be controlled. These units form the basis of a quick method for adjusting a controller on the job. The effect of varying each controller setting is shown in a series of chart records. It is believed that the conceptions of control presented in this paper will be of assistance in the adjustment of existing controller applications and in the design of new installations.}},

@article{epoxy_humidity,
	abstract = {In this paper we propose a new multistep characterisation method to be able to map out the dependency of moisture diffusion parameters of a polymeric material over a range of temperature and humidity conditions in a limited amount of time. We do that by (1) using a moisture sorption analyser which can continuously monitor weight changes with microgram accuracy, (2) using thin samples which speeds up the diffusion process and (3) already switch to the next humidity level at 90 or 95\% completion of a diffusion step. A multistep diffusion model was developed to account for the overlapping diffusion steps. This model showed to be extremely accurate for fitting experiments consisting of five absorption and one desorption steps. We show that for temperatures up to 85 °C and humidity level between 0 and 85\% RH the diffusion of our material was essentially Fickian with a diffusion coefficient ranging from 3.8 \ensuremath{\times} 10−7 mm2/s at 20 °C to 3.6 \ensuremath{\times} 10−6 mm2/s at 85 °C. The moisture saturation concentrations showed a slightly non-linear variation with the applied humidity level.},

The Schawlow-Townes and time-averaged linewidths depend on free parameters of the design, such as cavity length, power, and grating characteristics. We show that the linewidth is also sensitive to the focus, set by the distance between the laser and the collimating lens, due to the effect on the external cavity backcoupling efficiency. By considering these factors, a simple ECDL can readily achieve linewidths below 100 kHz.},

@article{blue_laser_diodes_history,
	abstract = {In this paper we shall discuss the development of blue light-emitting (LED) and laser diodes (LD), starting early in the 20th century. Various materials systems were investigated, but in the end, the nitrides of aluminum, gallium and indium proved to be the most effective. Single crystal thin films of GaN first emerged in 1968. Blue light-emitting diodes were first reported in 1971. Devices grown in the 1970s were prepared by the halide transport method, and were never efficient enough for commercial products due to contamination. Devices created by metal–organic vapor-phase epitaxy gave far superior performance. Actual true blue LEDs based on direct band-to-band transitions, free of recombination through deep levels, were finally developed in 1994, leading to a breakthrough in LED performance, as well as nitride based laser diodes in 1996. In 2014, the scientists who achieved these critical results were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.},

@book{advanced_pid_control,
	abstract = {The authors of the best-selling book PID Controllers: Theory, Design, and Tuning once again combine their extensive knowledge in the PID arena to bring you an in-depth look at the world of PID control. A new book, Advanced PID Control builds on the basics learned in PID Controllers but augments it through use of advanced control techniques. Design of PID controllers are brought into the mainstream of control system design by focusing on requirements that capture effects of load disturbances, measurement noise, robustness to process variations and maintaining set points. In this way it is possible to make a smooth transition from PID control to more advanced model based controllers. It is also possible to get insight into fundamental limitations and to determine the information needed to design good controllers. The book provides a solid foundation for understanding, operating and implementing the more advanced features of PID controllers, including auto-tuning, gain scheduling and adaptation. Particular attention is given to specific challenges such as reset windup, long process dead times, and oscillatory systems. As in their other book, modeling methods, implementation details, and problem-solving techniques are also presented.},

In this article, analytical expressions are derived for performance characteristics of non-ideal Howland Current Pump, and it is shown that the main characteristics can be adjusted using three independent parameters: resistors’ scale, feedback ratio, and current sensing resistor’s value. The derived expressions are evaluated by computer simulations, and then are used to design a current pump for an impedance cardiography system, as an example. Performance of the circuit is evaluated based on simulations and experimental tests, and then is compared with several previous designs in the literature. The relationships provide a unified framework for the analysis of different configurations of Howland current pump and can facilitate its design process for different applications with specific performance requirements.},

The investigation was extended to nonlaser diodes made of identical heterostructures. The attainment of the lasing threshold was accompanied by a negative drop of several ohms in the differential resistance of a diode. This effect was in agreement with a simple model of the junction effect. Quenching of the lasing resulted in an abrupt increase in the voltage across a diode (by tens of millivolts). These abrupt changes in the resistance and voltage were correlated with a jump in the output power.},

It is found that the dependence of the differential resistance upon the injection current differs in the GaAs- and GaN-based LDs mainly in two aspects. The first is the kink polarity of the differential resistance in the vicinity of the threshold current, and the second is the behavior of the differential resistance curve beyond the threshold current. Self-consistent calculation results suggest that the LD kink and its polarity are determined by the superposition effects of the n-side, active and p-side regions of LDs. It is found that this kink mainly differs in the differential resistance curves of the active region, while the difference in the behavior of the differential resistance curve after the lasing threshold is ascribed to a resistance change in the p-side region caused by a reduced ideality factor.}},

The application of this philosophy to the construction and operation of a precision proportional thermostat for geophysical accelerometers in boreholes is described in detail. The thermostat discussed is of small size and weight, is simple to operate, and requires less than 5 W of power. It maintains the temperature of an instrument and its vacuum enclosure of 1688 cm3 total volume and 7 kg mass constant within 10 \ensuremath{\mu}°C over periods of days in the presence of fluctuations in the ambient temperature of several degrees. Various models of the thermostat, with several different configurations of thermal insulation, have been tested extensively in both laboratory and borehole environments. Stable proportional operation has been achieved with setpoint temperatures ranging from 15 to 35 °C and with the difference between the setpoint and mean ambient temperatures varying from 4 to 10 °C. The electronic circuitry is designed to provide a maximum heater power of 15 W, and the thermistor is calibrated over the range −40–150°C. With suggested modifications, the thermostat is applicable to a variety of instruments over a fairly wide temperature range.}},

However, the propagation delay (lag) between heater and sample can limit the control bandwidth. Moving the sensor closer to the heater reduces the lag and increases the bandwidth but introduces offsets and drifts into the temperature of the sample. Here, we explore the consequences of using two probes—one near the heater, one near the sample—and assigning the integral term to the sample probe and the other terms to the heater probe. The split-PID algorithm can outperform PID control loops based on one sensor.}},

Both numerical and analytic evaluations of a e up to ( \ensuremath{\alpha} / \ensuremath{\pi} ) 4 are firmly established. The coefficient of ( \ensuremath{\alpha} / \ensuremath{\pi} ) 5 has been obtained recently by an extensive numerical integration.

The discrepancy between a e ( theory ) and a e ( ( experiment ) ) is 2.4 \ensuremath{\sigma} .

The trap, dedicated to spectroscopy and imaging of confined particles under large solid angles, is of “half-open” design with one open endcap and one closed endcap that mainly consists of a glass window coated with a highly transparent conductive layer. This arrangement allows for the trapping of externally or internally produced particles and yields flexible access for optical excitation and efficient light collection from the trapping region. At the same time, it is electrically closed and ensures long-term ion confinement under well-defined conditions. With its superior surface quality and its high as well as homogeneous optical transmission, the window electrode is an excellent replacement for partially transmissive electrodes that use holes, slits, metallic meshes, and the like.}},

	abstract = {Mit Hilfe von optischen Messmethoden können atomare Strukturen mit außerordentlicher Präzision untersucht werden. Abweichungen von den theoretischen Vorhersagen können dabei Hinweise auf neue physikalische Effekte liefern. Daher kommt Präzisionsmessungen an atomaren Übergängen auch in Zukunft große Bedeutung zu. Mit der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde ein Lasersystem für Präzisionsmessungen an Bismuth (209 Bi82+ ), Tellur (130 Te2 ) sowie Rydberg-Zuständen von Rubidium (85 Rb) entwickelt und charakterisiert. In der Anwendung konnten spektroskopische Frequenzmessungen an Tellur und Rubidium realisiert werden. Das Lasersystem besteht aus einem zweifach frequenzverdoppelten Diodenlaser, der über einen optischen Resonator und ein RF-Schwebungssignal bei allen zugänglichen Wellenlängen absolut stabilisierbar ist. Der Aufbau des Lasersystems wird vorgestellt sowie die systematischen Abweichungen diskutiert, die durch Druckabhängigkeit des Brechungsindex der im Transferresonator enthaltenen Luft entstehen. Für ein geplantes Experiment zur Messung der Hyperfeinaufspaltung des Grundzustands von 209 Bi82+ ergibt sich eine Stabilität, die besser als 6,14 MHz bei 244 nm ist. Dies erlaubt eine Verbesserung der Präzision der Übergangsfrequenzmessung von vier Größenordnungen. Durch die Nutzung eines bereits installierten evakuierten Resonators lässt sich die Präzision zusätzlich steigern. Die erreichte Genauigkeit wird an einer 130 Te2 -Spektroskopie bestimmt. Acht aus der Literatur bekannte Referenzlinien mit Frequenzen zwischen 613720,717 GHz und 616803,545 GHz wurden erneut aufgenommen. Bei drei Linien, die im Emissionsspektrum eines Argon-Ionen-Lasers liegen, wurde eine Abweichung zu den in der Literatur angegebenen Frequenzen festgestellt. Weitere Unklarheiten in der Literatur werden behoben. Ebenfalls Teil dieser Arbeit ist die erstmalige präzise Vermessung von 843 dopplerfreien Referenzen zwischen 613881,150 GHz und 616614,258 GHz mit einer Genauigkeit von größtenteils unter 4 MHz. Des weiteren werden Messungen der elektromagnetisch induzierten Transparenz (EIT) an Rydberg-Übergängen von 85 Rb vorgestellt. Aufgenommene Übergangslinien mit Hauptquantenzahlen von n=20, 58, 79, 97 und 150 werden vorgestellt. Beispielhaft am Übergang mit dem Rydberg-Zustand 97 2 D an 85Rb wird das auftretende Spektrum an Zwei-Photonen-Resonanzen bei Variation von Anfangs-, Zwischen- und Endzustand analysiert und erklärt. Die Energieverschiebung von Unterzuständen durch elektrische und magnetische Felder wird untersucht. Durch eine Frequenzmessung am Zwei-Photonen-Übergang 5 2 S1/2 {$\rightarrow$} 150 2 D5/2 wird die Ionisationsenergie von 85 Rb erneut bestimmt. },

	abstract = { We present experimental data on visible transitions in highly charged ions observed in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) electron beam ion traps, including results from lines within the ground-state configuration and the first excited configuration. Measurements of lines produced by Kr (q = 11+ to 22+), Xe (q = 18+ to 35+), and Ba (q = 28+ to 36+) ions, corresponding mainly to 3sl 3pm 3dn configurations, were carried out. The ionization stages were determined experimentally by sweeping the electron beam energy over the ionization threshold of each species. We propose possible identifications for the lines with the help of simple atomic structure calculations. However, most observed lines remained unidentified, demonstrating that the understanding of visible spectra from highly charged ions, even if obtained under nearly "ideal" experimental conditions, is still in its infancy. These spectral data may be useful for the diagnostics of magnetically confined plasmas and may set the stage for future measurements of radiative lifetimes. In our experiments, we used the emission from visible lines to image the intersection of the electron beam with a beam of neutral atoms injected into the trap at a right angle as well as the ion cloud in the trap. Under some conditions, the diameter of the ion cloud may be an order of magnitude larger than that of the electron beam. PACS Nos.: 32.30Jc, 39.30+w, 52.59Rz },
