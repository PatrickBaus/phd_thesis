The starting point has been the IMC-PID tuning rules that have achieved widespread industrial acceptance. The rule for the integral term has been modified to improve disturbance rejection for integrating processes. Furthermore, rather than deriving separate rules for each transfer function model, there is a just a single tuning rule for a first-order or second-order time delay model. Simple analytic rules for model reduction are presented to obtain a model in this form, including the ``half rule'' for obtaining the effective time delay.},

Corresponding units are proposed for a classification of industrial processes in terms of the two principal characteristics affecting their controllability. Formulas are given which enable the controller settings to be determined from the experimental or calculated values of the lag and unit reaction rate of the process to be controlled. These units form the basis of a quick method for adjusting a controller on the job. The effect of varying each controller setting is shown in a series of chart records. It is believed that the conceptions of control presented in this paper will be of assistance in the adjustment of existing controller applications and in the design of new installations.}},

@article{epoxy_humidity,
	abstract = {In this paper we propose a new multistep characterisation method to be able to map out the dependency of moisture diffusion parameters of a polymeric material over a range of temperature and humidity conditions in a limited amount of time. We do that by (1) using a moisture sorption analyser which can continuously monitor weight changes with microgram accuracy, (2) using thin samples which speeds up the diffusion process and (3) already switch to the next humidity level at 90 or 95\% completion of a diffusion step. A multistep diffusion model was developed to account for the overlapping diffusion steps. This model showed to be extremely accurate for fitting experiments consisting of five absorption and one desorption steps. We show that for temperatures up to 85 {\textdegree}C and humidity level between 0 and 85\% RH the diffusion of our material was essentially Fickian with a diffusion coefficient ranging from 3.8 {\texttimes} 10−7 mm2/s at 20 {\textdegree}C to 3.6 {\texttimes} 10−6 mm2/s at 85 {\textdegree}C. The moisture saturation concentrations showed a slightly non-linear variation with the applied humidity level.},

The Schawlow-Townes and time-averaged linewidths depend on free parameters of the design, such as cavity length, power, and grating characteristics. We show that the linewidth is also sensitive to the focus, set by the distance between the laser and the collimating lens, due to the effect on the external cavity backcoupling efficiency. By considering these factors, a simple ECDL can readily achieve linewidths below 100 kHz.},

@article{blue_laser_diodes_history,
	abstract = {In this paper we shall discuss the development of blue light-emitting (LED) and laser diodes (LD), starting early in the 20th century. Various materials systems were investigated, but in the end, the nitrides of aluminum, gallium and indium proved to be the most effective. Single crystal thin films of GaN first emerged in 1968. Blue light-emitting diodes were first reported in 1971. Devices grown in the 1970s were prepared by the halide transport method, and were never efficient enough for commercial products due to contamination. Devices created by metal--organic vapor-phase epitaxy gave far superior performance. Actual true blue LEDs based on direct band-to-band transitions, free of recombination through deep levels, were finally developed in 1994, leading to a breakthrough in LED performance, as well as nitride based laser diodes in 1996. In 2014, the scientists who achieved these critical results were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.},
