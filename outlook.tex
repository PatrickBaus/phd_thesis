\label{sec:outlook}
This work has pushed the boundaries of diode laser systems to a new level. Diode lasers built using the technology presented in this work will see their limits in the mechanical design rather than the control electronics. The design presented allows precision laser spectroscopy even in the presence of adverse environmental conditions that would otherwise pose serious challenges to the experimenter.

The development of such high precision devices as they are typically required for university labs has become more challenging over the recent years due to the decline in availability of many electronic parts. These shortages mostly affect microcontrollers and power electronics. It is the authors desire to make the instruments presented in this work available to the public via an open-source contribution of the design files and also to keep them available. This necessitates a few updates to the designs to make them more resilient to supply chain issues. The author proposes the following changes to the designs presented in this work.

The \device{DgDrive} laser current driver should be modified with the careful addition of an FPGA on the analog side to simplify the digital isolation between the front panel and the analog electronics. Recent developments have demonstrated that reducing the number of critical components like the digital isolators makes the construction more resilient to the varying supply and requires less requalification when replacing unavailable parts. The use of an FPGA can also simplify many of the logic elements on the board by bringing them into the FPGA core. Being able to change this logic software also improves the compatibility with future part changes. The FGPA also allows for smaller and simpler microcontroller, giving more options when adapting to supply changes. Another interesting new development that is currently pursued is the integration of the new ADI \device{ADR1399} reference Zener diode which has shown promising results regarding the burst noise issue as well as deliver a lower floor. Given those early results future batches of the current driver may not even need the additional screening process of the Zener diodes discussed in section \ref{sec:zener_diode_selection}. This would greatly simplify the manufacturing process in terms of hardware and time required.

Much of the same as said above can be said about the temperature controller. The supply situation is even more dire in this case, because many of the specialised parts come with tight specifications. For example the \device{LTC2508-32} ADC used in the analog front end is explicitly tailored to the microcontroller. Adding an FPGA front end for the ADCs can greatly simplify and even improve the performance of the system as it is right now. With the advent of new high performance ADCs in recent years an FPGA also gives the needed flexibility when choosing suitable substations if the need arises. The work on these changes was already started, but is not yet finalised.

Regarding the driver board of the temperature controller, the availability of the new ADI \device{LT8722} TEC driver is much anticipated because it integrates many of the components used on the driver board into a single chip allowing a simpler design, reducing the production cost and complexity. This presents a key feature to further the widespread adoption of the design.

These developments are independent of the benefits than can already be reaped from the designs currently available. The new laser system built for the ARTEMIS experiment is expected to deliver the much desired stability for the spectroscopy of \ce{Ar^{13+}}. Clearing the commissioning of the Penning trap is major step forward and and also opens up the road towards the spectroscopy of Bismuth (\ce{^{209}Bi^{82+}}) as the new electronics can provide the needed stability for the seed laser at \qty{976}{\nm}. Parts of this system integrating the new electronic are currently being performance tested. Some of this work was already presented in \cite{thesis_tilman}.

Additionally, the new control electronics allows the use of a wide variety of modern laser diodes and opens up other experimental avenues like the spectroscopy of highly charged Krypton \ce{Kr^{17+}} at \qty{636.9}{\nm} \cite{krypton17+,krypton17+_2}.

A final aspect that has come up with the new electronics are the limits of the mechanical design of the laser resonators. While not surprising, the unsealed laser makes for a good barometer as shown in figure \ref{fig:atomics_master_barometer}.

The piezo mounted inside the resonator moves the back reflecting mirror to follow the air pressure and to keep the laser frequency locked to the rubidium transition. The piezo voltage closely follows the changes in air pressure.}

An o-ring seal, like demonstrated by \cite{ecdl_silicone_housing}, can improve the stability of the diode lasers and ensure the performance of the system becomes insensitive to weather conditions. In addition, the ample use of epoxy resin inside the resonator causes a sensitivity to humidity as the epoxy resin swells when exposed to water \cite{epoxy_humidity}. \citeauthor{thesis_tilman} \cite{thesis_tilman} already presented major improvements by presenting a mechanical mount for the collimation lens, but both the back reflecting mirror and the lenses forming the \textit{cat-eye} \cite{ecdl_paris} are fastened using epoxy resin. The currently employed technique of using silica gel to maintain a constant humidity should be superseded by a more permanent solution. A sealed resonator can therefore add an import part to the day-to-day stability of the experiments.
